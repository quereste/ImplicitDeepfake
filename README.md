# ImplicitDeepfake

We would like depict steps to reproduce outcomes we achieved and described in paper "ImplicitDeepfake: Plausible Face-Swapping through
Implicit Deepfake Generation using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting".

# Citation

We would like to express our gratitude to the authors of Gaussian Splatting and NeRF model, along with the pytorch representation of the latter. We used Gaussian Splatting and NeRF to achieve 3D rendering results.

As the classical 2D deepfake we used GHOST model.
